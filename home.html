    <p>Aim for three to five  <br /><br />or more sentences per paragraph. Include on each page about two handwritten or three typed paragraphs. Make your paragraphs proportional to your paper. Since paragraphs do less work in short papers, have short paragraphs for short papers and longer paragraphs for longer papers.</p>

    <div>Dear Students,

        As indicated in NYU Shanghai COVID-19 Code of Conduct, students should not leave Shanghai during the Fall 2020 semester in order to minimize any risk of spread to the larger community. Our university must adhere to the guidelines issued by the local authorities to ensure our ability to deliver the in-person class experience that we are privileged and fortunate to provide to the NYU Shanghai and Go Local program community. 
        
        Students should follow the process listed below. Changes to this process will be communicated in advance to the NYU Shanghai community.
        
        Request for Travel Exception  
        If students must leave Shanghai due to academic reasons, medical/family emergencies, or extenuating circumstances, they should submit a request to the university through this form at least 7 business days ahead of their travel.
        
        The university will review the students’ request within 5 working days after receiving the request form.
        
        Students will receive a confirmation email of whether the request was approved or denied. If approved, please follow the detailed return to campus instructions. In general, students will lose campus card access during the period in which they are away from Shanghai. 
        
        Students will need to re-apply campus access once they return to Shanghai. 
        
        
        Important Reminders
        The current government policy requires students either to stay in Shanghai for more than 14 days OR they would need to take a Nucleic Acid Test in order to regain the campus access.
        To be exempted for the Nucleic Acid Test, the following conditions will be taken into consideration and each request will be treated case by case:
        Demonstrate a closed-loop plan where the point-to-point destination can be traced if necessary.
        Taking private transportation rather than public transportation
        Does not include an overnight stay
        The venue has strict COVID-19 risk management plans (i.e. a exam testing location is at a university or school) 
        The university will randomly conduct travel code ("行程码“) checks during the semester, if the "行程码“ shows any locations outside of "Shanghai" while students did not submit a travel exception request, they may face disciplinary actions from the university.
